# maternal-health-risk-prediction-Machine-Learning-Model
This project develops an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for maternal health risk prediction using clinical parameters such as blood pressure, blood sugar, heart rate, and body temperature. It implements Random Forest and Dense Neural Network models, evaluates clinical performance metrics and deploys a Gradio-based web application
